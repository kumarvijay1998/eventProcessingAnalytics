Here i will explain my thought process to solve the problem of Data Aging and Historical insights.

1. with the time the data will be huge so the in memory data structure will become bottleneck.
2. using some nosql database to store the different attributes will make our solution scalable.
3. using some nosql db mongodb
    a. It will offer us flexibility.
    b. The queries can be done easily on this db.
    c. approapriate indexing for ex. on timestamp would make our queries/apis even faster.
4. we can expose the same result through flask apis.
